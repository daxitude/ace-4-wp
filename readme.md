# ACE Editor for WP

Adds ACE Editor to the post content editor for syntax-highlighting and more.


## Installation

See [Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).

1. Download the zip or clone and drop it into your site's wp-content/plugins directory.
1. Navigate to your site's Admin->Plugins section (wp-admin/plugins.php) and activate the plugin.
1. Go edit a post/page/custom-post-type, or add a new one, and look for the ACE tab next to the Visual and HTML Mode tabs at the top right of the content editor box. If you don't see the Visual tab, that's great! It means you or someone else disabled Visual Mode. That'll make toggling between modes a much more pleasant experience (see more in release notes).
